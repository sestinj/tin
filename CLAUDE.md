# Tin

Thread-based version control for conversational coding. Wraps git, treating conversation threads as the primary unit of change.

## Important: Use Tin Commands

**Always use built-in tin commands instead of git commands or directly modifying `.tin/` storage on disk.**

### Committing: Use `tin commit`, NOT `git commit`

When committing changes in a tin repository, **always use `tin commit`** (or the `/commit` slash command). The `tin commit` command:
1. Automatically stages all changed files to git
2. Creates a git commit with thread metadata in the message
3. Creates a tin commit linking the conversation thread to the code
4. Updates the thread status

Using `git commit` directly will lose the thread context and break the tin workflow.

### Other examples:
- Use `tin thread delete` instead of `rm .tin/threads/<id>.json`
- Use `tin add --unstage` instead of editing `.tin/index.json`

Direct file manipulation can leave the repository in an inconsistent state (e.g., orphaned staging entries, missing index updates).

## Quick Reference

```bash
tin init                  # Initialize (also runs git init if needed)
tin status                # Show current branch and staged threads
tin branch [name]         # List or create branches
tin checkout <ref>        # Switch branch/commit (restores git state)
tin add <thread-id>       # Stage a thread (or --all)
tin commit -m "msg"       # Commit staged threads
tin log                   # Show commit history
tin thread list           # List all threads
tin thread show <id>      # Display thread conversation
tin thread delete <id>    # Delete a thread (use -f for committed/active)
tin hooks install         # Install Claude Code hooks (--global for ~/.claude)
tin hooks uninstall       # Remove hooks
tin amp pull [id|count]   # Pull threads from Amp CLI
```

## Project Structure

```
cmd/tin/main.go           # Entry point
internal/
  commands/               # CLI command implementations
  model/                  # Message, Thread, TinCommit, Branch structs
  storage/                # .tin directory operations
  hooks/                  # Claude Code hook handlers + installation
```

## Data Model

- **Message**: hash (merkle chain), role, content, timestamp, tool_calls, git_hash_after
- **Thread**: id (first message hash), agent, messages[], parent refs for branching
- **TinCommit**: id, message, thread refs, git_commit_hash

Storage in `.tin/`: threads/, commits/, refs/heads/, index.json (staging), HEAD

## Agent Integrations

### Claude Code

Hooks auto-track conversations:
- `SessionStart` → new thread
- `UserPromptSubmit` → append human message, auto-stage
- `Stop` → append assistant response + tool calls + git hash
- `SessionEnd` → mark thread complete

Slash commands: `/branches`, `/commit [msg]`, `/checkout [branch]`

### Amp

Pull threads from Amp CLI:
```bash
tin amp pull                    # Pull latest thread
tin amp pull 5                  # Pull 5 most recent threads
tin amp pull T-019b7d09-...     # Pull specific thread by ID
tin amp pull https://ampcode.com/threads/T-...  # Pull by URL
```

Threads are deduplicated by Amp thread ID (stored in `AgentSessionID`).

## Building

```bash
go build -o tin ./cmd/tin
```

## Feedback: Test Driving Tin

We are test driving `tin`, which means it is really important to collect feedback on how it works in real-world situations, and whether the workflow is ergonomic. If you ever come across small bugs, workflow issues, awkward details, or even just situations where the mental model doesn't make sense or you are running too many commands repeatedly, log these observations in a file called `OBSERVATIONS.md`. It should be a markdown file, section-separated by `---` between each observation. The observations should be concise descriptions of what was noticed.
